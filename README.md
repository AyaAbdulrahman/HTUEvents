Modifications!

Splash screen: 
Added the logo with a simple pulse animation along with the login button color to match.

Login screen:
A simple login screen as the app has no backend hence the lack of register option and handling or proper authorization management.

Home screen:
Added categories to better layout the events and make browsing them easier using titles
Each event has a card with its cooresponding poster and details like title, date, and location
Each category uses horizental scroll to view all the relevent events in it

Details screen:
When it comes to the UI it looks like a card with the events details
Bellow it is a button to confirm RSVP and when pressed it becomes disabled and changes its color to grey (no backend integr=eration so the changes arent saved for the accounf logged into)
Added a back button for navigation

Profile:
Added icons and changed the layout of the page and style of the logout button

Overall I focussed on the frontend aspect by changing the UI of all the screens (splash, login, home, details, profile). The goal was to make it simple, clear and easy to use.
I used expo go to test and view the changes made in the app.
